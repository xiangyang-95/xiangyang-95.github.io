# 0x01 - Hello Readers

Date: 3/9/2025

Welcome — and thanks for stopping by. This is the first post on a personal blog where I'll share thoughts, experiments, and projects at the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, and optimization. My aim is to document practical work, explain ideas simply, and build a small, thoughtful archive of what I learn.

## About me (quick)

I'm a practitioner who enjoys turning AI models into working systems. I split time between research-style experiments and engineering: prototyping perception or control pipelines, tuning models, and getting reliable demos out the door.

My interests center on:

- Large language model training, finetuning and inferencing optimization.
- Vision perception model training and finetuning.  

Expect explanations grounded in code and reproducible steps whenever practical.

## What to expect

- Short essays exploring algorithms, models, and trade-offs.
- Project write-ups with code snippets, diagrams, and lessons learned.
- Walkthroughs on robotics integrations (perception, control, simulation).
- Notes on optimization techniques — where they matter in practice.

Posts will vary in depth. Some will be quick progress notes. Others will be longer tutorials or reproducible experiments.

## Closing

Thanks for reading this first note. If you enjoy clear explanations, reproducible experiments, and practical robotics + ML engineering, you’re in the right place. I’ll try to publish regularly and keep posts focused and useful.

— See you in the next post.
